## Introduction

![FullSetup](./Documentation/HowToGuides/Installation/Capture.PNG)


> **Requires** Unity Editor 2017.4 +

![Full_Animation]


## Important usage

- Place VRTK4_UICanvas on each canvas
- ON ALL UI ELEMENTS - buttons, sliders, inputfields, toggles, dropdown -> YOU MUST REMOVE DEFAULT UNITY NAVIGATION (navigation = none)!
- You may leave Blocking mask as None (this way you will save on performance - no 3D raycasts will be performed)
- To Ignore Player Objects - Use Component VRTK4_Player Object (collision detection)
- Also, if you are using Pseudobody - add pointers to the IgnoredGameObjectList
- when using animations on the UI canvas -> add box collider on it in Editor mode -> Colliders are created at the awake - so it can be different when the target canvas is animated!
- When using Unity Event Triggers -> pointers will always perform their separate OnEnter/OnExit -> so please see Unity Event Triggers usage script
- All input fields must hide soft keyboard and hide mobile input. There is no default keyboard in this package. Please Use Custom one.
- When using input fields -> VR + Input Field Caret is not working properly. Make sure to use custom caret. Example See here -> https://gist.github.com/studentutu/714d78ad6cebfe147bfa852fb7046a90
