> **Requires** Unity Editor 2017.4 +

![Full_Animation]


## Important usage
This package only covers use case with a **UI layer** for casting UI elements.

1) Place **VRTK4_UICanvas** on each canvas
    - ON ALL UI ELEMENTS - buttons, sliders, inputfields, toggles, dropdown -> YOU MUST REMOVE DEFAULT UNITY NAVIGATION (**navigation = none**)!
    - You may leave Blocking mask as None (this way you will save on performance - no 3D raycasts will be performed)

2) If you need drag and drop functionality on the UI: enable **supportDragAndDropUI** on the **VRTK4_UICanvas** (use custom gameobject with name **CANVAS_DRAGGABLE_PANEL**, or default one will generated). Note : default CANVAS_DRAGGABLE_PANEL is placed first,it will block all previous canvases or canvases that are behind it.  

2) To ignore player objects : use component **VRTK4_PlayerObject**

3) If you are using **Pseudobody** - add pointers to the **IgnoredGameObjectList**

4) Just as with standart unity 3D raycasting (enabling cast on world objects) : Add **VRTK4_3DGraphicRaycaster** and setup interactive layers. See here : ![Vrtk3DCasts]


Other important notes: 

- When using animations on the UI canvas: add box collider on it in Editor mode, otherwise UI colliders are created at the Awake, with canvas delta size ( example animation from small to large size).

- When using Unity Event Triggers: pointers will always perform their separate OnEnter/OnExit -> so please see **TiliaUnityEventTriggerSubscriber** correct usage script

- All input fields must hide soft keyboard and hide mobile input. There is no default keyboard in this package. Please use custom one.

- When using input fields:  VR + Input field caret is not working properly. Make sure to use custom caret script. Example see here -> https://gist.github.com/studentutu/714d78ad6cebfe147bfa852fb7046a90

See full scene and a separate prefab here :

/Runtime/Example/TestScene -> here is a full scene with Custom Rig and UI Pointers attached. 
Note : on the Event system added VRTK4_EventSystem, VRTK4_VRInputModule, VRTK4_3DGraphicRaycaster

/Runtime/SharedResources/Prefabs/[L_R]_ UI Pointer on Interactor.prefab  -> default UI Pointer, needs additional setup with Pointer, actions and PointerFacade
